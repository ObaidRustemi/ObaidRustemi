# About Me
I am a passionate and extroverted Software Developer with dreams to start my own AR company. I am an absolute geek about the future of tech, specifically: Augmented Reality, AI, blockchain, and automated technologies like self-driving cars. 

I am strengthening my coding skills through a year long intensive Fellowship at Pursuit, a NYC-based web development fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. When I'm not reading about the tech industry, you'll find me traveling the world, reading anything I can get my hands on, or talking to strangers in an attempt to satisfy my endless curiosity about what makes the world tick.
